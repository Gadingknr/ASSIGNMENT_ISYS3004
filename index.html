      <h1>HI, My name is Gading</h1>
      <p> I am a young and high-achieving commerce student at Curtin University, majoring in Business
        Information Systems and also studying Cybersecurity in a form of bootcamp. I am currently
        doing an internship program at Zoodata and also seeking job opportunities where I can apply
        my knowledge and skills for continuous improvement. I would like to pursue my interest in the
        business field, especially in the area of Technology. I would like to bring all my competencies
        from my past experiences as well as my approachable nature and my customer service to your business.
